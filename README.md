YRS 2014 Festival of Code - Cycle Routes
========================================


###What it Does
_____________________

**It generates a route that has stops every 30 minutes, where you switch bikes, so that you avoid paying more than the Â£2 charge for the day.**

###How to operate
________________________

1. Get current location / input start location
2. Choose destination

________________________


###Implementation

1. Find nearest stations near your current location.
2. Find the point on your journey where you will be in the (30 - k)th minute - i.e. when k = 5, the 25th minute.
3. Find the docking stations near that point.
4. Choose the station that;
	+ Takes less than k minutes to get to.
	+ Has free bike docking points.  
	+ Closest to the overall route (you don't want to go out of your way)
5. Repeat - finding directions from the current docking station you have stopped at.

**You must wait 5 minutes before taking another ride. We are making the assumption that you will wait exactly 5 minutes and leave from the same docking station.**

### 'Back End' Usage

Named `process.php`

You pass in the 'to' and 'from' coordinates.

`from_longitude`  
`from_latitude`  
`to_longitude`  
`to_latitude`

**Sample request**

e.g. London Zoo to Big Ben  

`.../process.php?from_longitude=-0.155715844&from_latitude=51.535630782&to_longitude=-0.124572515&to_latitude=51.500645178`

**You can use the start and end point coordinates returned to confirm the request is the latest**
